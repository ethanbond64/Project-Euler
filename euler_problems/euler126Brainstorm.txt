C(n) = # of possible cuboids or cuboid wraps that contain n cubes in one of the layers (so C(n) > 1)

So given example, there are 10 cuboid layers which have 154 cubes in them

Naive methods:
generate combinations of cuboids up to the size,
upper bound would be the base cuboid with the most surface area w/ a first (or minimum) *layer* equal to 154

cuboid layer generation:
given xyz
3,2,1 -> 6 cubes

add
2*1 in x,
3*1 in y,
3*2 in z,   
all doubled because each end --> +22 cubes

example model after layer (m = original on the side)
mx+2(my+mz), my+2(mx+mz), mz+2*(mx+my) :: 2+6,3+8,6+10 :: surface area per side


OR BY ORDER, x takes precedence
2,3,6    outermost
6,8-2,10-10    inner (subs because earlier dimension handled)

= 2[2+3+6] + 2*[6+6+0] = 22 + 24 = 46
